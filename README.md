### I am entirely self taught, learning with the abundance of educational articles, videos, and projects I find online.
### This is portfolio to document projects I've done, and any other ramblings I have.

#### Currently: Studying for the Security+, working on projects to develop my technical skills, and applying for entry-level jobs specifically as a security analyst.
