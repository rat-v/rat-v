## Introduction
#### This portfolio is dedicated to the documentation my technical projects and notes.

#### I am a recent graduate of Pharmaceutical Sciences looking for a career change to pursue what I am truly passionate about: technology and problem solving.

#### I am entirely self taught, learning with the abundance of educational projects, articles, and videos I find online.

#### Currently: Studying for the Security+, always working on projects to develop my practical skills, and applying for entry-level jobs specifically as a security analyst.
